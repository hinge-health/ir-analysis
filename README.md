# IR-Analysis: Incident Recovery Data Analysis Tool

A comprehensive tool for extracting and analyzing incident data from Jira and Confluence, with advanced RCA (Root Cause Analysis) content analysis capabilities.

## Overview

This tool pulls incident data from Hinge Health's IR (Incident Recovery) board in Jira, matches incidents with their corresponding RCA documents in Confluence, and provides detailed analysis including:

- **Incident Data Extraction**: Complete incident metadata, urgency levels, and team involvement
- **RCA Document Matching**: Automatic linking to Confluence RCA documents
- **Enhanced Analysis**: LLM-powered extraction of incident summaries, user impact, and root causes
- **CSV Export**: Structured data export for further analysis and reporting

## Features

### âœ… Current Features (Phase 1-3)
- **Jira Integration**: Extract all IR incidents since January 1, 2024
- **Custom Field Support**: Incident Urgency (P1-P4) and Pods Engaged
- **Confluence Integration**: Automatic RCA document discovery and linking
- **Data Quality**: 126 incidents retrieved, 72.2% RCA match rate
- **CSV Export**: Clean, structured data export

### ðŸš§ In Development (Phase 4-5)
- **LLM-Powered RCA Analysis**: Extract structured insights from RCA documents
- **Enhanced Data Fields**: Incident summaries, user impact metrics, root cause analysis
- **Quality Validation**: Analysis confidence scoring and validation
- **Advanced Reporting**: Comprehensive data quality and analysis reports

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Atlassian account with access to Hinge Health Jira and Confluence
- API token for Atlassian services

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ir-analysis.git
   cd ir-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
