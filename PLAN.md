# Incident Analysis Project Plan

## Project Overview
Build a system to pull incident data from Jira and Confluence to analyze company incidents registered on the IR (Incident Recovery) board since January 1, 2024.

## Data Sources & Requirements

### Jira Configuration
- **Project**: IR (Incident Recovery board)
- **Date Filter**: Created since January 1, 2024
- **Status Exclusions**: "Duplicate", "Not an Incident"
- **JQL Query**: `project = IR and created > '2024-01-01' and status not in (Duplicate, "Not an Incident")`

### Key Jira Fields
- **Ticket Key**: Primary identifier
- **Summary**: Incident title
- **Incident Urgency**: Custom field (P1-P4 priority)
- **Description**: Jira ticket description
- **Pods Engaged**: Custom field identifying involved teams
- **Comments**: Source for RCA document links (posted by "Automation for Jira")

### Confluence Integration
- **Location**: RND/Incident Response/RCA Documents

## RCA Content Analysis Implementation

### LLM Analysis Strategy (Recommended: Claude Code)
**Why Claude Code**: Built-in, no additional API costs, excellent at document analysis, already integrated

### Content Extraction Process
1. **Confluence API**: Retrieve RCA document content as HTML/markdown
2. **Content Preprocessing**: Clean HTML, extract main content, remove navigation
3. **LLM Analysis**: Use structured prompt to extract key information
4. **Data Validation**: Validate and clean extracted data
5. **CSV Integration**: Add analysis results as new columns

### Analysis Prompt Template
```
Analyze this Root Cause Analysis document and extract the following information in JSON format:

INCIDENT SUMMARY: Provide a 1-paragraph executive summary (2-3 sentences) of what happened, when, and the business impact.

USERS IMPACTED: Extract the number and type of users affected. Look for:
- Specific user counts (e.g., "1,200 users", "15% of members")
- User segments (e.g., "PT users", "new members", "iOS users")
- Impact duration (e.g., "30 minutes", "2 hours")

ROOT CAUSES: Identify primary and contributing root causes. Look for:
- Technical root causes (code bugs, infrastructure failures, configuration issues)
- Process root causes (deployment issues, monitoring gaps, human error)
- Environmental factors (third-party services, network issues)

Format as JSON:
{
  "incident_summary": "...",
  "users_impacted": "...",
  "root_causes": ["primary cause", "contributing cause 1", "contributing cause 2"]
}

RCA Document Content:
[DOCUMENT_CONTENT]
```

### Enhanced CSV Columns
**Existing**: Ticket Key, Summary, Incident Urgency, Jira Description, RCA Link, Pods Engaged, Created, Status

**New RCA Analysis Columns**:
- **Incident Summary**: Executive summary from RCA analysis
- **Users Impacted**: Extracted user impact information
- **Root Causes**: Structured list of identified root causes
- **Analysis Quality**: Confidence score of LLM extraction (High/Medium/Low)

### Technical Implementation Options

#### Option 1: Claude Code Built-in (RECOMMENDED)
**Pros**: 
- No additional API costs or setup
- Excellent document analysis capabilities
- Already integrated with your environment
- Can process documents in batches

**Implementation**:
```python
def analyze_rca_content(confluence_content: str) -> dict:
    # Use Claude Code's built-in analysis capabilities
    # Process through internal analysis functions
    pass
```

#### Option 2: OpenAI API Integration
**Pros**: Specialized LLM API, structured outputs
**Cons**: Additional API costs (~$0.50-2.00 per 100 RCAs), requires API key
**Cost Estimate**: ~$20-50 for 126 documents

#### Option 3: Local LLM (Ollama/LlamaCpp)
**Pros**: No API costs, full control
**Cons**: Requires local setup, potentially lower quality analysis

### Performance Considerations
- **Rate Limiting**: Process RCAs sequentially to avoid overwhelming systems
- **Caching**: Cache analysis results to avoid re-processing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for analysis failures
- **Quality Validation**: Verify extracted data makes sense

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement request throttling and retry logic
- **Missing RCA Documents**: Track and report unmatched incidents
- **LLM Analysis Failures**: Implement fallback strategies and quality validation
- **Content Parsing Issues**: Handle various RCA document formats gracefully
- **Authentication Issues**: Clear setup documentation and error messages
- **Data Quality**: Validation checks and quality reporting
